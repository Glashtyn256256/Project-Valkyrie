# Project-Valkyrie
Project Valkyrie was a prototype group project working with another developer and three artists. In the game, you play as the Valkyrie virus, infecting a human body.   Accumulate    points by destroying as many white blood cells as possible and  killing the boss to determine your ranking on the high score table.

[This group project was created in our first year, no knowledge of source control at the time and was all done manually]
